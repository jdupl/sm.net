### Recommended additionnal setup

To avoid having 10.2.0.1 as your main DNS, it is recommended to use Unbound.

The example below will forward all DNS requests to `8.8.8.8` except for `sm`.
All domains ending with `sm` will use the VPN's DNS server.

```
server:
  use-syslog: yes
  username: "unbound"
  directory: "/etc/unbound"
  auto-trust-anchor-file: "/var/lib/unbound/root.key"
  do-not-query-localhost: no
  forward-zone:
    name: "."
    forward-addr: 8.8.8.8@53
  forward-zone:
    name: "sm."
    forward-addr: 10.2.0.1@53
```

### Support
The configurations are tested on Debian

### Other Linux Distributions
Before starting the openvpn service, make sure you have the linux group nogroup added to your system(e.g. Arch Linux, Fedora, etc...). If your don't want the nogroup added to your system, another option is to simply change the group in your configuration file to match your current system(e.g. nobody instead of nogroup).
